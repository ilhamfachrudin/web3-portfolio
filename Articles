# What is DeFi?

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a financial system built on blockchain technology that allows users to access financial services without intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions.

In traditional finance, banks act as middlemen to manage transactions, savings, loans, and investments. DeFi removes these intermediaries by using smart contracts, which are automated programs running on the blockchain.

## Key Characteristics of DeFi
- Permissionless: Anyone can access DeFi applications without approval.
- Transparent: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- Non-custodial: Users have full control over their assets.

## Common DeFi Applications
- Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)
- Lending and Borrowing platforms
- Liquidity Pools
- Yield Farming

## How DeFi Works
DeFi applications operate through smart contracts. These contracts automatically execute transactions when predefined conditions are met, reducing the need for trust in third parties.

## Conclusion
DeFi represents a new approach to financial services by offering transparency, accessibility, and automation through blockchain technology.
