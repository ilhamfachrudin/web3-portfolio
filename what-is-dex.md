# What is a DEX?

## Definition
A DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade digital assets directly from their wallets without relying on a centralized intermediary.

Unlike centralized exchanges (CEX), DEX platforms operate using smart contracts on the blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer trading in a trustless and transparent way.

## How a DEX Works
DEX platforms use smart contracts to automatically execute trades. Instead of order books managed by a central entity, most modern DEXs use liquidity pools where users supply tokens and earn fees in return.

Key components:
- Smart contracts to handle trades
- Liquidity pools funded by users
- Automated Market Makers (AMM)
